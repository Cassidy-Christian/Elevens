List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠
A possible play would be replacing the 5♠ and 6♣ cards. Another play would be replacing the 5♣ and 6♣ cards. 

If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not?
They would have to be a King, Queen, and an Ace. Every number card has a match. Only these ranks don't have match that add up to 11. There is no way to have just three cards left and for them not to be a Face Card. If we've already taken out all of the triplets, then there would have to be an even amount of cards left. 

Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer.

It doesn't matter which Elevens pair( ie. Ace+ten and 2+9) we get rid of first because the cards that you get rid of and the cards that you select afterwards are mutually exclusive. The state of one doesn't depend on the state of another. Even if you have the case with deciding between a pair or a triplet, no matter what you will be putting in the same 5 cards afterwards. We cannot control the deck; it has already been decided.
